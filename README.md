## Implementation of a given paper
### Primary Reference:
> Bias Correction of Learned Generative Models using Likelihood-Free Importance Weighting  
> [Aditya Grover](https://aditya-grover.github.io), Jiaming Song, Alekh Agarwal, Kenneth Tran, Ashish Kapoor, Eric Horvitz, Stefano Ermon.  
> Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09531  

### Differences with official implementation
1. Added PyTorch implementation of VAE models and 100K generated samples
2. Connected bits and pieces for seamless workflow 
3. Added results folder
